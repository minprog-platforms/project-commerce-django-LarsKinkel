# Auction Site

This repository includes an app that is made for Minor Programmeren at the UvA.
The app simulates an actual Auction site where one can bid on items and also sell items themselves. One with an account has some more functionalities than one without.


## Getting Started

Pull the repository from github to your computer, then get the app running by typing "python3 manage.py runserver". Copy the given url and paste it into your webbrowser to go to the actual webpage. The index page is the page where one can see the active listings. Clicking on the image or the title of an active listing takes one to the page of that single listing. On this page, you can bid on the item or put it into your watchlist (if logged in). The owner of an auction is also able to close the sale of an item once he or she is satisfied with the current highest bid. If you are on the page and the listing is closed while you are the highest bidder, the page will tell you that you won the auction.
